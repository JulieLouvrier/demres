The goal of __{demres}__ is to provide easy functions to calculate different time-varying and time- constant demographic resilience metrics. It also allows plotting the resulting metrics and measuring the discrepancy between the time-varying and the time-constant approach. 

The different metrics provided are:   
- Convergence time    
- Damping ratio    
- Inertia  
- Reactivity   
- Maximum amplification   
- Maximum attenuation   

It is build around one dependency:

- [__{popdemo}__](https://github.com/r-lib/rlang)

__{demres}__ aims at being compatible with both _tidyverse_ and _base_ R dialects.

# Matrix Population Models
## Blue cran models

We will use a list matrix projection models (MPMs) of a blue crane population (*Anthropoides paradiseus*) in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa, from the study by Altweg and Anderson 2009: "Rainfall in arid zones: possible effects of climate change on the population ecology of blue cranes" [^1].

The MPMs were extracted from the COMADRE database (https://compadre-db.org/). The data is a list of 12 matrices of dimension 5 x 5. The 5 stage classes have been defined based on age and are the following:     
- "1 year"    
- "2 years"    
- "3 years"    
- "4 years"    
- "5 years"

```

The numbers in the matrices describe the probability of transitioning from stages described in columns to stages described in rows, between time intervals that are relevant to the species, in the case of the blue crane, years. For blue cranes, the probability to move from a 1 year old to a 2 year old is 61.2% on year 5 of the study (see `bluecrane[[5]]`), while this probability is 88.7% in year 2 of the study period (see `bluecrane[[2]]`).

# Assess time-varying demographic resilience 
The function `resilience` is made to calculate demographic resilience metrics based on a list of Matrix Population Models. It returns a `dataframe` with time-varying demographic resilience metrics with the option `time = "varying`.

The different resilience metrics that are calculated[^2] can be :         

- _**Convergence time**_ :  time to convergence of a population matrix projection model from the model projection.         

- _**Damping ratio**_ : Dimensionless measure of convergence to stable growth. Smaller numbers represent slower convergence. Damping ratio is calculated using 

$$\textit{damping ratio} = {\rho} = \frac{\lambda_1}{||\lambda_2||}$$
With $\lambda_1$ the dominant eigenvalue and $\lambda_2$ the largest subdominant eigenvalue.

- _**Inertia**_ : The long term population density in comparison with a population that reached a stable growth. Inertia is calculated using  

$$\textit{inertia} = {\rho}_{\infty} = \frac{\textbf{v}_{max}||\textbf{w}||_1}{\textbf{v}^\text{T}\textbf{w}}$$ 

in case of an amplifying population and 

$$\textit{inertia} = {\rho}_{\infty} = \frac{\textbf{v}_{min}||\textbf{w}||_1}{\textbf{v}^\text{T}\textbf{w}}$$ 
in case of an attenuating population. 

With **w** and **v** are right and left eigenvectors respectively. $\textbf{v}_{min}$ and $\textbf{v}_{max}$ represent the smallest and largest entries of **v**. $||\textbf{w}||_1$ represents the one-norm of **w** (equals to the sum of its entries). 

- _**Reactivity**_ : The population density that can be reached in the first time step after disturbance. Reactivity is calculated using  

$$\textit{reactivity} = \bar{\rho_1} = ||\hat{\textbf{A}} \hat{\textbf{n}}_0||_1$$
With **A** the matrix population model and $\hat{\textbf{A}}$ the standardized population model which is calculated as $\hat{\textbf{A}} = \frac{A}{\lambda_{1}}$. The vector $\hat{\textbf{n}}_0$ represents the initial demographic distribution, standardized to sum to 1 and is calculated as $\hat{\textbf{n}}_0 = \frac{{\textbf{n}}_0}{||\textbf{n}_0||_1}$. 

- _**Maximum amplification**_ : The largest population density that can be reached at any time after disturbance. This metric is calculated using:
$$maximum\ amplification = \bar{\rho}_{max} = \max_{t > 0}||\hat{\textbf{A}}^t\hat{\textbf{n}}_0||_1$$

- _**Maximum attenuation**_ : The lowest population density that can be reached at any time after disturbance. this metric is calculated using 

$$maximum\ attenuation = \underline{\rho}_{min} = \min_{t > 0}||\hat{\textbf{A}}^t\hat{\textbf{n}}_0||_1$$
Maximum amplification and maximum attenuation can occur at any point along the projection. Some populations only have a maximum amplification due to either their demographic structure or the initial vector (because they never attenuate), some only have a maximum attenuation (because they never amplify), and some have both.

The function `resilience` can compiles each of the aforementioned metric, calculated for each matrix that was made at each time step of the length of the study.  

The parameters to specify are: 
•	`listA`: a list of square, primitive, irreducible, non-negative numeric matrices of any dimension       

•	`metrics`: Character string. The user can specify either one or several resilience metrics of their choice, The metrics have to be specified as either “`convt`” (for convergence time), "`reac`" (for reactivity); “`inertia`”, “`dr`” (for damping ratio); “`maxamp`” (for maximum amplification); “`maxatt`” (for maximum attenuation); or “`all`” to compute all of the aforementioned metrics. By default set to “`all`”.             

•	`bounds`: Boolean. optional parameter if the user wants to calculate the upper and lower bounds calculated from the stage-biased vectors. By default set to `TRUE`.         

•	`vector`: Numeric. can be a numeric vector or a list of numeric vectors describing the age/stage distribution ('demographic structure') used to calculate a 'case-specific', stage age structure metric.       

•	`TDvector`: Boolean. Specifies whether or not the user wants to get a Time-Dependent list of initial vectors, corresponding to the population stage distribution projection for each year with each matrix of each year. The result is a list of X initial vectors with X the number of matrices that are in the list. By default set to `FALSE`.        

•	`popname`: Character string describing the name of the population.       

•	`time`: Character string: "`constant`" (if the metrics are to be calculated over the whole study period); "`varying`" (if the metrics are to be calculated for each time step) or "`both`”.          

•	`accuracy`: Numeric. This is an option taken from the function convt from popdemo to use when calculating the convergence time. It is a numeric value between 0  and 1 representing the  accuracy with which to determine convergence on asymptotic growth, expressed as a proportion. By default set to 0.01.         

•	`iterations`: This is an option taken from the function `convt` from `popdemo` to use when calculating the convergence time. It represents the maximum number of iterations of the model before the code breaks. By default set to 1e+05. 

•	`verbose`: Boolean. If set to `TRUE` it will display the warning messages that are produced when assessing the demographic resilience metrics. By default set to `TRUE.`        

If bounds = `TRUE` but no vector is specified, the function provides metrics in their upper and lower bound, calculated based on the stage-biased vector. If vector is specified, the function additionnally provides the metrics calculated based on the provided initial vector.

## Calculating one resilience metric 
In a first time we can look at `inertia`, by setting `metrics = "inertia"`and `time = varying`. 

```{r echo = -1}
set.seed(1234)
Cranevec1 <- runif(5)
Cranevec1 <- Cranevec1/sum(Cranevec1) 

Bluecrane.inertia.tv <- resilience(
     listA = bluecrane,
     metrics = "inertia",
     bounds = TRUE,
     vector = Cranevec1,
     popname = "blue crane",
     time = "varying")

Bluecrane.inertia.tv
```
Here we can see that inertia varies in time, because `bounds`were set to `TRUE`, the values of inertia were calculated also based on the stage biased vector. Stage-biased vectors are biased towards one stage-class, with individuals from this stage-class representing 100% of the whole population. Consequently there are as many stage-biased vectors as there are stage classes in the population. For example, a population with 4 stage classes will have the 4 following stage-biased vectors: [1 0 0 0]; [0 1 0 0]; [0 0 1 0]; [0 0 0 1 ]. These upper and lower bounds therefore provide the extreme best- or worst-case scenarios.


The minimum values for inertia calculated either with the vector or with the bounds were all found during the 5th year of the study period. While its maximum was reached on the second year. An inertia of 1.5 means that after the transient period, the population would settle to a size 1.5 times as large as a population that grows with stable rate.

In a second time we can look at `reactvity` by setting `metrics = "reac"`
```{r echo = -1}
Bluecrane.reac.tv <- resilience(
     listA = bluecrane,
     metrics = "reac",
     bounds = TRUE,
     vector = Cranevec1,
     popname = "blue crane",
     time = "varying")

Bluecrane.reac.tv
```

A reactivity of 1.32 would mean that in the first timestep, the population grows 1.32 as fast as its stable growth rate.It is therefore amplifying. 

## several metrics
Now let's look at all the metrics possible with the option `metrics = "all"`

```{r echo = -1}
Bluecrane.all.tv <- resilience(
     listA = bluecrane,
     metrics = "all",
     bounds = TRUE,
     vector = Cranevec1,
     popname = "blue crane",
     time = "varying")

Bluecrane.all.tv
```

This time we have an objetc of type "resil" that is a dataframe, of 16 columns. 

```{r echo = -1}
colnames(Bluecrane.all.tv)
```

All 6 metrics are given with their upper and lower bound when possible. Error messages were displayed due to the fact that the bounds were requested for maximum amplification and maximum attenuation, but the lower bound cannot be calculated for maximum amplification and the upper bound cannot be calculated for maximum attenuation. 

The lower and upper bounds are calculated based on the stage-biased vector, therefore we warn the users to interpret the results with caution when looking at the lower and upper bounds of convergence time. Convergence time represents the number of time-steps it will take for the population to reach asymptotic growth rate. Therefore, the stage-biased vectors might lead to longer convergence time than when calculated with an initial vector representeing more realistic demographic structure. 

Given the population demographic structure given in $\hat{\textbf{n}}_0$ it appears that for none of the years the population would attenuate, and rather amplifies.

## Time-dependant initial vector
It is also possible to derive a list of initial vectors starting with one vector representing the demographic structure of the first time-step (option `TDvector = TRUE` for Time-Dependent vector).

The population is projected on the next time step based on the provided demographic distribution and the respective MPMs for that time-step. The demographic structure of the following time step is then calculated based on that projection and the population is then projected again based on this resulting demographic structure and the respective MPM. This process continues for as many time-steps as there are.      

From that point, we will set `verbose = FALSE`to avoid the display of all the error messages 

```{r echo = -1}
Bluecrane.all.tv.TD <- resilience(
     listA = bluecrane,
     metrics = "all",
     bounds = TRUE,
     vector = Cranevec1,
     TDvector = TRUE,
     popname = "blue crane",
     time = "varying",
     verbose = FALSE)

Bluecrane.all.tv.TD
```
Here in that case, we can see that values differ from the previous `Bluecrane.all.tv` as we can see that inertia and reactivity have values that are below 1 when the vector provided is time-dependant, meaning that the population is attenuating rather than amplifying during these years.  

In comparison with the previous table, one can see that the values of inertia and reactivity converge towards 1 over time. As we are projecting the population over time, it is expected to have the population approaching asymptotic growth, however the variations around 1 are showing the temporal variations of the demographic rates.

The values of inertia and reactivity calculated with the time-constant approach are also much closer to 1 than when the time-dependant vector is not used because the initial vector is averaged over the years of projection, getting clsoer to the stable stage structure of the population. If we were to compare the time-varying approach with a time-dependant initial vector to the time-constant approach with the initial vector equal to the first entry of the time-dependant series of vector, the differences between the time-varying and the time-constant approach would be even greater. 

Note that it is also possible to provide a list of initial vectors, of length the number of MPMS that are in ListA. This can be used when users have information about the actual demographic strucure of their study population over time. 

# Assess time-constant demographic resilience
## one metric
In a first time we can look at `inertia` again
```{r echo = -1}
Bluecrane.inertia.tc <- resilience(
     listA = bluecrane,
     metrics = "inertia",
     bounds = TRUE,
     vector = Cranevec1,
     popname = "blue crane",
     time = "constant",
     verbose = FALSE)

Bluecrane.inertia.tc
```
Here we can see that inertia is calculated based on the mean MPM and is around 1.53 with a lower bound of 0.34 and an upper bound of 2.45. 

## several metrics
We can look now at all metrics with the option `metrics = "all"`
```{r echo = -1}
Bluecrane.all.tc <- resilience(
     listA = bluecrane,
     metrics = "all",
     bounds = TRUE,
     vector = Cranevec1,
     popname = "blue crane",
     time = "constant",
     verbose = FALSE)

Bluecrane.all.tc
```

The population does not attenuate based on the average matrix.

# Compare time-varying resilience vs time-constant resilience 
## one metric
```{r echo = -1}
Bluecrane.reac.tvtc <- resilience(
     listA = bluecrane,
     metrics = "reac",
     bounds = TRUE,
     vector = Cranevec1,
     popname = "blue crane",
     time = "both", 
     verbose = FALSE)

Bluecrane.reac.tvtc
```
Both time-varying and time-contant approaches are displayed in the table for reactivity. 

## several metrics
```{r echo = -1}
Bluecrane.all.tvtc <- resilience(
     listA = bluecrane,
     metrics = "all",
     bounds = TRUE,
     vector = Cranevec1,
     popname = "blue crane",
     time = "both", 
     verbose = FALSE)

Bluecrane.all.tvtc

```
Because `verbose = TRUE` we can see the error messages displayed for each time step of the time varying approach, as well as the error message for the time-constant approach. 

# Assess the distance between the time-varying and the time-constant metrics 

The function `summary` calculates the distance between the time-varying resilience metric and the time-constant one. The following commonly used distances can be measured: 
residual mean squared error: 
$$RMSE = \sqrt{mean((TV-TC)^2)}$$ 
relative residual mean squared error: 
$$rRMSE = \frac{\sqrt{mean((TV-TC)^2)}}{sd(TV)}$$ 
and the mean absolute proportional error 
$$MAPE = \frac{mean(abs(TV-TC))}{TC}$$ 
with $TV$: the time-Varying resilience metric and $TC$ the time constant one. 

## One variable
Let's look at how the metrics vary in time in comparison with the time-constant approach. Looking first at `reactivity`.
To be able to look at these measures, both time-varying and time-dependant approaches must be present in the table. 

```{r echo = -1}
table.bc.reac <- summary(Bluecrane.reac.tvtc)

table.bc.reac
```
The upper bound has the largest values of RMSE. This means that the upper bound is the one for which the time-varying values are the mose dispersed around the time-constant value.When dividing this value by the standard deviation of the time-varying metric, it seems that all three metrics have a rRMSE below 1, which means that the value of the RMSE is below the value of the sd of the time-varying metrics, which can be interpreted as a reasonable dispersion around the time-constant metric. Finally, when looking at the MAPE, if 5% is considered the maximum threshold above which the difference between the time-varying and the time-constant approaches, then the upper bound is the metric for which the time varying approach represents a sensible approach in comparison to the time-constant one.  

## Several metrics
Then let's look at all the variables. 

```{r echo = -1}
table.bc.all <- summary(Bluecrane.all.tvtc)

table.bc.all
```
First, we can notice that the distance measures for maximum attenuation cannot be computed because the population did not attenuate according to the time-constant approach. 
Looking at the RMSE, convergence time is the metric with the largest values. This is due to the the fact that convergence time is expressed in number of time steps, therefore the values can greatly vary, and are much larger than the values of the other metrics that are around 1. Secondly, when looking at the rRMSE, all values seem to be below 1, expressing a dispersion that is acceptable. However when looking at the MAPE, convergence time calculated based on an initial vector and its bounds, the upper bound of inertia, the upper bound of maximum amplification, and the upper bound of reactivity are metrics for which the MAPE is above 5%. For these metrics, we can consider that the time-varying is more sensible thant the time-constant approach.

It is now worth investigating the reasons behind the fact that the upper bound appears to be the metric that varies the most in time. 

# Check the stage-biased vectors 
Let's first remember the initial vector we used 

```{r echo = -1}
Cranevec1
```
For this initial vector, adults were largely represented, with juveniles being in minority. 
Now we will create the 5 stage-biased vectors of our population and identify to which cases the upper and lower bounds are found

```{r echo = -1}
## creating the stage-biased vectors
year1 <- c(1,0,0,0,0)
year2 <- c(0,1,0,0,0)
year3 <- c(0,0,1,0,0)
year4 <- c(0,0,0,1,0)
year5 <- c(0,0,0,0,1)

list.initvec <- list(year1,
                      year2,
                      year3,
                      year4,
                      year5)


list.demres <- lapply(X = list.initvec, 
                      FUN = resilience, 
                      listA = bluecrane,
                      popname = "bluecrane",
                      bounds = TRUE,
                      metrics = "all",
                      verbose = FALSE)


list.demres
```

If there is an over-representation of individuals in stages with low survival and zero/low fertility, then the population will grow slower (or decline faster) than the stable rate (i.e. attenuates). In our case, a bias towards year 1 seems to be the one that leads to the lower bound, which means that if only juveniles: the population attenuates the most. A bias towards year 2 also seems to make the population attenuate.   

If there is an over-representation of individuals in stages with high survival and/or fertility, then the population will grow faster (or decline slower) than the stable rate (i.e. amplifies). In our case, a bias towards year 5 seems to be the one that leads to the upper bound, which means that if only adults: the population amplifies. 

Therefore the maximum amplification in that case represents how the population would evolve if adults only would constitute the population, representing the temporal variation in their survival and fertility. This parameter appeared to be influence by the years, however showing little variation over time in comparison with the variation in survival of other age classes. This demonstrates the fact that little variations in adult survival lead to large differences of output in terms of demographic resilience.

## What happens when we use a time-dependant initial vector? 
In that case, if `time = "both"`the time-constant demographic resilience metrics are calculated based on the average vector over the years. 

```{r echo = -1}
Bluecrane.all.tvtc.TD <- resilience(
     listA = bluecrane,
     metrics = "all",
     bounds = TRUE,
     vector = Cranevec1,
     TDvector = TRUE,
     popname = "blue crane",
     time = "both",
     verbose = FALSE)

table.bc.all.TD <- summary(Bluecrane.all.tvtc.TD)

table.bc.all.TD

```
In this case, the distance measures are very different. Convergence time is still the metric that shows the highest values of RMSE, however the rRMSE values show this time that the convergence time and maxamp both have a RMSE wider than the sd,highlighting a broad dispersion around the time-constant value. 
Finally, when looking at the MAPE, almost all metrics this time show a MAPE above 5% except for damping ratio, the lower bound of maximum attenuation and the lower bound of reactivity. 
Values of damping ratio are not changing in that case becase it is calculated based on the properties of the matrix and does not depend on the initial vector. 

When initial vectors also depend on time, we can conclude that the time-varying approach is even more sensible in that case than when using only one initial vector. 

# Check extreme years 

We have seen already that the year 2 was the best in terms of highest values of demographic rates, while the year 5 was the year during which the demographic rates were at their lowest. 

Let's see how this translates in terms of demographic resilience metrics 

### Maximum values 
```{r echo = -1}
#maximum values 
apply(Bluecrane.all.tv[-c(1:2)],2,which.max)

```
The second year is the year during which most of the demographic resilience metrics are at their maximum value. The population amplifies, given the initial vector that was provided, however the extent of the amplification remains close to 1, with inertia of 1.6, a maximum amplification of 1.9 and a reactivity close to 1.4. the maximum the population amplifies is around 3.7, which remains reasonable. However, during the second year is also the highest value of convergence time and the lowest value of damping ratio. Given that the closer to 1 the damping ratio is, the slower the population converges, we can conclude that during the second year, the population reaches maximum values of amplification but converges the slowest. 


### Minimum values 
```{r echo = -1}
#minimum values 
apply(Bluecrane.all.tv[-c(1:2)],2,which.min)

```

Now looking at the minimum values, we can observe that the 5th year was the year during which the demographic resilience metrics were at their lowest, however with convergence time at its lowest value and damping ratio at its highest value, displaying a trade-off between amplification and convergence. 

# Plot 
The function `plot` provides a visual representation of the time-varying and time-constant metrics that are present in the dataframe returned by the function `resilience`. Depending on what the user specified as demographic distribution, the plot shows the resilience metrics computed by using  the lower bound, the upper bound, or  the initial distribution vector. 

```{r echo = -1}
plot(Bluecrane.all.tvtc)

```
