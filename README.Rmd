# demres

The goal of __{demres}__ is to provide easy functions to calculate different time-varying and time- constant demographic resilience metrics. It also allows plotting the resulting metrics and measuring the discrepancy between the time-varying and the time-constant approach. 

The different metrics provided are:   
- Convergence time    
- Damping ratio    
- Inertia  
- Reactivity   
- Maximum amplification   
- Maximum attenuation   

It is build around one dependency:

- [__{popdemo}__](https://github.com/r-lib/rlang)

__{demres}__ aims at being compatible with both _tidyverse_ and _base_ R dialects.

## Package installation

You can install this package using __{remotes}__ (or __{devtools}__):

```{r, installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("JulieLouvrier/demres")

```

## Basic usage of the package
### Load the package {demres}

```{r, loading pkg}
library(demres)
```

### Import Matrix Population Models 
```{r, import data}
# load data
data(bluecrane)

```

### Calculate demographic resilience metrics based on a list of population matrices

The function `resilience` is made to calculate demographic resilience metrics based on a list of matrix projection models. It returns a `dataframe` with both time-varying and time-constant approaches when required with the option `time`.

```{r, resilience metrics}
# Create initial vector
set.seed(1234)
Cranevec1 <- runif(5)
Cranevec1 <- Cranevec1 / sum(Cranevec1) #scales the vector to sum to 1

#let's calculate all metrics of demographic resilience for that one matrix with one initial vector
BlueCrane_demres <- resilience(
    listA = bluecrane,
    metrics = "all",
    bounds = TRUE,
    vector = Cranevec1,
    TDvector = TRUE,
    popname = "blue crane",
    time = "both",
    verbose = TRUE )

#let's take a look at what we got
BlueCrane_demres
```

### Assess the distance between the time-varying and the time-constant approaches

The function `summary` calculates the distance between the time-varying and the time-constant approaches by using the RMSE, rRMSE or the MAPE: 

#### RMSE: 
$$\sqrt{mean((TV-TC)^2)}$$   
with TV - the time-varying resilience metric and TC - the time-constant one

#### rRMSE: 
$$\sqrt{mean((TV-TC)^2)} / sd(TV)$$   

#### MAPE: 
$$\frac{mean(abs(TV-TC))}{TC}$$ 

```{r, distance}
#let's calculate all measures of distance for inertia
dist_BC <- summary(BlueCrane_demres)

#let's take a look at what we got
dist_BC
```

### Plot the results

Function `plot` provides a plot to visually inspect the resilience metric along a time axis

```{r, plotting}
plot(BlueCrane_demres)
```

**Vik**: these links point to locations on your personal PC and are broken if someone uses them from outside your PC (e.g. they do not
work for me). Consider adding these plots to a folder "plots" (or so) on the package, so that they will be directly available. And why can't you directly visualise them using that plot() function? (I guess because it needs the user to switch the window...)
